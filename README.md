## Descriptions
An automation bot for Instagram that uploads photos from a specified directory to your Instagram account continuously. This bot processes images, ensuring they meet Instagramâ€™s format requirements (JPEG, 1080x1080px), and posts them with customizable captions. It runs in a loop, uploading a large batch of images to Instagram while handling various error cases, including challenges, to ensure smooth operation.
This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of uploading images to Instagram. It uses the `instabot` package for interacting with Instagram's API and `PIL` for image processing. The bot is designed to continuously upload images from a local folder, ensuring they are resized to the appropriate dimensions and format for Instagram. It handles challenges and errors during the login and uploading process, making it suitable for long-running automation tasks.

### Features:
 - Logs into Instagram automatically.
 - Processes images to meet Instagram's photo requirements.
 - Handles transparency in PNGs by adding a white background.
 - Uploads photos continuously, with a configurable delay between uploads.
 - Capable of running for extended periods, uploading multiple images (up to 1000 or more).

### Requirements:
 - Python `3.x`
 - `instabot` library
 - `Pillow` for image processing
